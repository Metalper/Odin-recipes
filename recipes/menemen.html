        <h4>How to make menemen?</h4>
            
            <p>The print-friendly recipe is just below, but here is how to make it step-by-step for those of us who are more visual:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cook the onions, peppers and tomatoes</strong></li>
                The first step is to make the chunky tomato mixture. Chop up 1 green pepper (I used mild bell pepper) and 1 yellow onion. Grab a good 10-inch pan (I use cast iron, but you can use any skillet or pan of this size). Heat up some good extra-virgin olive oil and sauté the onions and peppers, seasoned with a good pinch of kosher salt, for a little bit until softened (about 5 minutes).

                <li> <strong>Add tomatoes and tomato paste</strong> </li>
                Add chopped tomatoes (2 vine-ripe tomatoes) and 3 tablespoon of tomato paste. Season with a little more kosher salt. Add black pepper, ½ teaspoon dried oregano and 1 teaspoon Aleppo-style pepper, which is not super hot but adds a nice kick with some subtle sweetness to this dish. Cook over medium heat until the tomatoes soften, for about 7 minutes.

                <li> <strong>Add the eggs and cook gently</strong></li>
                Keep the tomato mixture in the skillet, but push it to one side. Lower the heat to medium-low, add 4 beaten eggs and cook gently until the eggs are just set. <br>
                <li><strong>Fold the tomato mixture into the eggs</strong></li>
                When the eggs are just set, use a wooden spoon and fold the tomato mixture into the eggs and mix gently (don't linger too long here so you do not overcook the eggs).

                <li><strong>Finish with olive oil and more seasoning</strong></li>
                As soon as the tomato mixture and eggs are incorporated, immediately remove the skillet from the heat. Taste and adjust seasoning. Add a good drizzle of some excellent extra virgin olive oil and a dash more Aleppo-style pepper. And, if you're looking for more heat, a good pinch of hot red pepper flakes. Serve immediately with some good hearty bread (thicker slices of bread are best).
            <P><strong>Bon Apetite</strong></P>
            </ul>
