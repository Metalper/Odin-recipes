        <h4>Description</h4>

                Think of Lahmacun, pronounced Lahamajoun, as super thin, crispy pizza topped with a 
                flavor-packed mixture of minced meat with peppers, tomato, 
                resh herbs and earthy spices. I take a major shortcut by using quality
                store-bought pizza dough. But the secret is in the spice mixture!
                This lahmacun recipe is the perfect prepare-ahead lunch. And it's a
                great dinner on-the-go. To serve a crowd, slice it up and serve with 
                other Mezze favorites.

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <hr>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Adjust oven rack to the middle. (or see stove-top instructions in notes)
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Prepare the meat mixture. In the large bowl of a food processor, fitted with blade, add red peppers, shallot, garlic, and parsley. Pulse a few times to chop. To the mixture, add ground lamb (or beef). Season with spices and salt. Add tomato paste and extra virgin olive oil. Now pulse again until well-combined (about 8 to 10 pulses.)
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Prepare two large rimmed baking sheets lined with parchment paper (you'll be using these to bake the Lahmacun in batches.)
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Divide the pizza dough into 4 equal balls (about 2 oz each.) Working with one ball of dough at a time, place on a floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll dough out into as thin as you can to a disk that's about 8 or 9 inches in diameter. 
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Assemble Lahmacun. Place one flatbread disk on one of the prepared pans. Reshape as needed.  Spoon 3–4 tablespoon topping onto dough and spread topping evenly to edges, leaving a thin boarder.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Bake in heated oven for about 5 to 7 minutes or until dough and meat are fully cooked (dough will be a little crusty around the edges.)
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Repeat steps 5 and 6 with the remaining dough.</li><br>
                    <li>Squeeze a little lemon juice on top. Serve Lahmacun hot or at room temperature.  See notes below for how to serve.
                    </li>
